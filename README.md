Sorting and General algorithms and the effects they have in a social network like Instagram

The project has two parts, the first one where I coded some sorting algorithms like SelectionSort, QuickSort, MergeSort and RadixSort.
In the second part, the theme was General computing algorithms, so I coded Backtracking, Branch&Bound, Greedy, and the combination of Backtracking and Branch&Bound with Greedy.

The objective of the project was to clearly see the increase in performance we could have when using specific algorithms instead of loops.
It was very clear, that when working with large datasets, depending on the operation we were doing, some algorithms were better (performance-wise) than others, but always better than a classic loop.
