# InstaSalle Computation Algorithms

In this part of the project, after implementing the different algorithms, we tested the time performance of each one, which are Backtracking, Branch&Bound,  and Greedy.

In the paper called InstaSalle2.pdf, I detailedly explained how the program was coded, how it was tested, a few graph comparatives between the time it took the algorithms to finish a task, and the conclusions of the project.

In short, there were two main tests, which consisted of finding the best path between the users and the servers, similar to "The traveling salesman problem".
The second test was about distributing users between the different servers, similar to "The knapsack problem".
In both cases, we had different sized datasets, which contained the users and servers information in JSON format.
