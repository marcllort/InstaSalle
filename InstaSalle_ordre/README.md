# InstaSalle Order

In this part of the project, after implementing the different sorting algorithms, we tested the time performance of each one, which are SelectionSort, QuickSort, MergeSort and RadixSort.

In the paper called InstaSalle.pdf, I detailedly explained how the program was coded, how it was tested, a few graph comparatives between the time it took the algorithms to finish a task, and the conclusions of the project.

In short, there were three main tests, which consisted of sorting different json datasets, with a size from 1K to 1M users/posts.
The sorting was done by timestamp and location.
